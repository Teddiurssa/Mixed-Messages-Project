# Mixed Messages Project - What's for Dinner? 

This project is an portfolio project from Codeacademy, which is part of the Full-Stack-Path. 
For this project, I will be building a random message generator program with JavaScript. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output. I decided to make a Dinner Generator web app.

## General info
This is my first interactive page with JavaScript. My plan is to create a web app that a user will interact with to get a random recipe choice. I will be coding a basic page, that is styled with CSS and then add JavaScript to make the page work as I designed. My design has 10 recipes total that can be randomly chosen to make the choice of What's for Dinner?

## Technologies
* HTML & CSS
* JavaScript
* Git & Command Line
* Visual Studio Code

## Inspiration
We all have to deal with one of the hardest problems every day and that is whats for dinner. I struggle almost daily what to make for dinner and I believe this project is a good match to help with the problem.
